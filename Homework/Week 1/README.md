## The Problem
If you’re anything like me, you set your alarm for 5am every morning then proceed to hit snooze until 7. Your subconscious knows that you don’t have to be at work until 8:30 and laughs at your attempts to persuade it otherwise. 

## Device Summary
If your Id isn’t receiving the motivation it needs to lift you out of bed, there’s nothing quite like 800oC to get the job done.The Flamethrower Alarm Clock provides the catalyst you need to get you up on time and your day off to a productive start.

The device consists of a small, fireproof furnace inside of which you lock a high-value, flammable item. When the alarm rings, you must hit the off button in the allotted time, or your grandmother’s secret cookie recipe (for example) will be reduced to a pile of smoldering ash.
